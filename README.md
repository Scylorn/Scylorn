I procrastinate by watching videos on programming without actually doing any of my own.

Choise paralysis will drive you to dark and murky places.
This should emphasize the importance of minimal lifestyle.
Solve all your emergencies. Go learn Rust. Start making your game. Make a roadmap.
If you find yourself split at making choices, just return to what you decided to do earlier.
Start small. It's fine. Take your time. Let nihilism free you of worries about embarassing yourself.
Take a deep breath and go.
